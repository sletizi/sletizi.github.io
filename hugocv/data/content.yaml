Profile: Master's degree student passionate about teaching and excited for everything related to data in its various forms (Data Science - Data Engineering - BI). Data is evidence, and evidence fights ignorance and bias, as well as explaining most real-world dynamics. I have a strong interest in education because it is inspiring and compelling to passionately care about and be responsible for people who will be the next generation of innovators, as well as citizens of the world. Computer science is a meta-skill; its study becomes a conceptual and practical tool for creating, reasoning and learning about the dynamics that characterize most real-world domains.
