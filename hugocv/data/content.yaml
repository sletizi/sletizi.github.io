Profile: Master's degree in Computer Science passionate about teaching and excited for everything related to data in its various forms (Data Science - Data Engineering - BI). 

        Data is evidence, and evidence fights ignorance and bias, as well as explaining most real-world dynamics. 
        
        Thus, I've worked with many visualization tools, such as PowerBI, Tableau and QuickSight, in order to create dashboards that could show the information hidden in the data and help business decision making. 

        Capable of defining business needs, analyzing processes and making decisions for managing teams.

        Clear and effective presenting and visualizing results.

        I have a strong interest in education and I've had several experiences in this field.
