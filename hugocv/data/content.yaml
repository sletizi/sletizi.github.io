Profile: Data Expert (BI-DE) with a strong interest in education and mentoring. I have experience with visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau to support strategic business decisions. Proven skills in team management and presenting innovative solutions. One of the things I enjoy most about working with data is that data is evidence, and evidence fights ignorance and bias, as well as explaining most real-world dynamics.
